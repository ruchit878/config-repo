# **Lab 11: Implement Routing Rules and Custom Filters Using Spring Cloud Gateway (Spring Boot 3.4.5)**

## **Objective**
Learn how to configure **Spring Cloud Gateway** (on **Spring Boot 3.4.5**) to route requests to various microservices. Implement custom filters to intercept requests/responses, utilize route predicates for dynamic routing, and monitor the gateway with actuator endpoints.

...

## âœ… Conclusion

You now have:
- Functional API Gateway
- Working global and route filters
- Predicate-based routing
- Actuator monitoring

This forms the foundation for scalable microservice architecture using Spring Cloud Gateway.
